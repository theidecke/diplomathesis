title = {Gas Accretion from a Circumbinary Disk},
abstract = { A new computational scheme is developed to study gas accretion from a circumbinary disk. The scheme decomposes the gas velocity into two components one of which denotes the Keplerian rotation and the other of which does the deviation from it. This scheme enables us to solve the centrifugal balance of a gas disk against gravity with better accuracy, since the former inertia force cancels the gravity. It is applied to circumbinary disk rotating around binary of which primary and secondary has mass ratio, 1.4:0.95. The gravity is reduced artificially softened only in small circular regions around the primary and secondary. The radii are 7% of the binary separation and much smaller than those in the previous grid based simulations. 7 Models are constructed to study dependence on the gas temperature and the initial inner radius of the disk. The gas accretion shows both fast and slow time variations while the binary is assumed to have a circular orbit. The time variation is due to oscillation of spiral arms in the circumbinary disk. The masses of primary and secondary disks increase while oscillating appreciably. The mass accretion rate tends to be higher for the primary disk although the secondary disk has a higher accretion rate in certain periods. The primary disk is perturbed intensely by the impact of gas flow so that the outer part is removed. The secondary disk is quiet in most of time on the contrary. Both the primary and secondary disks have traveling spiral waves which transfer angular momentum within them. },

title = {The outcome of protoplanetary dust growth: pebbles, boulders, or planetesimals? II. Introducing the bouncing barrier},
abstract = {The sticking of micron sized dust particles due to surface forces in circumstellar disks is the first stage in the production of asteroids and planets. The key ingredients that drive this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions. Here we present the results of a collision model, which is based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU at the midplane at three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore we see long lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates due to bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity change upon varying the turbulence parameter and by varying the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10^-4 during the simulations. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations of the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to approximately 1 gram (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed via the turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted chondrule-sized particles.},

abstract = { Aims. This work reports radiative transition rates and electron impact excitation collision strengths for levels of the 3s23p, 3s3p2, 3s24s, and 3s23d configurations of Siii. Methods. The radiative data were computed using the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-Amaldi central potential, but with the modifications introduced by Bautista (2008) that account for the effects of electron-electron interactions. We also introduce new schemes for the optimization of the variational parameters of the potential. Additional calculations were carried out with the Relativistic Hartree-Fock and the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock methods. Collision strengths in LS-coupling were calculated in the close coupling approximation with the R-matrix method. Then, fine structure collision strengths were obtained by means of the intermediate-coupling frame transformation (ICFT) method which accounts for spin-orbit coupling effects. Results. We present extensive comparisons between the results of different approximations and with the most recent calculations and experiment available in the literature. From these comparisons we derive a recommended set of gf- values and radiative transition rates with their corresponding estimated uncertainties. We also study the effects of different approximations in the representation of the target ion on the electron-impact collision strengths. Our most accurate set of collision strengths were integrated over a Maxwellian distribution of electron energies and the resulting effective collision strengths are given for a wide range of temperatures. Our results present significant differences from recent calculations with the B-spline non-orthogonal R-matrix method. We discuss the sources of the differences. },

There will be analyzed simplified model - Boltzmann distribution among trajectories occurs to give quantum mechanic like behavior - for example electron moving in proton's potential would make some concrete trajectory which average exactly to the probability distribution of the quantum mechanical ground state. We will use this model to build intuition about quantum mechanics and discuss its generalizations to get some effective approximation of physics. We will see that topological excitations of the simplest model obtained this way already creates known from physics particle structure, their decay modes and electromagnetic/gravitational interactions between them. },

title = {Tracing the potential planet-forming regions around seven pre-main-sequence stars},
abstract = {Aims. We investigate the nature of the innermost regions with radii of several AUs of seven circumstellar disks around pre-main-sequence stars, T Tauri stars in particular. Our object sample contains disks apparently at various stages of their evolution. Both single stars and spatially resolved binaries are considered. In particular, we search for inner disk gaps as proposed for several young stellar objects (YSOs). When analyzing the underlying dust population in the atmosphere of circumstellar disks, the shape of the 10 μm feature should additionally be investigated. Methods: We performed interferometric observations in N band (8-13 μm) with the Mid-Infrared Interferometric Instrument (MIDI) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) using baseline lengths of between 54 m and 127 m. The data analysis is based on radiative-transfer simulations using the Monte Carlo code MC3D by modeling simultaneously the spectral energy distribution (SED), N band spectra, and interferometric visibilities. Correlated and uncorrelated N band spectra are compared to investigate the radial distribution of the dust composition of the disk atmosphere. Results: Spatially resolved mid-infrared (MIR) emission was detected in all objects. For four objects (DR Tau, RU Lup, S CrA N, and S CrA S), the observed N band visibilities and corresponding SEDs could be simultaneously simulated using a parameterized active disk-model. For the more evolved objects of our sample, HD 72106 and HBC 639, a purely passive disk-model provides the closest fit. The visibilities inferred for the source RU Lup allow the presence of an inner disk gap. For the YSO GW Ori, one of two visibility measurements could not be simulated by our modeling approach. All uncorrelated spectra reveal the 10 μm silicate emission feature. In contrast to this, some correlated spectra of the observations of the more evolved objects do not show this feature, indicating a lack of small silicates in the inner versus the outer regions of these disks. We conclude from this observational result that more evolved dust grains can be found in the more central disk regions.

The placement of frets on the fingerboard is designed according to mathematical rules and the assumption of an ideal string. The analysis becomes more complicated when we include the effects of deformation of the string and inharmonicity due to other string characteristics. As a consequence, perfect intonation of all the notes on the instrument cannot be achieved, but complex compensation procedures can be introduced to minimize the problem. To test the validity of these procedures, we performed extensive measurements using standard monochord sonometers and other acoustical devices, confirming the correctness of our theoretical models. These experimental activities can be integrated into acoustics courses and laboratories and can become a more advanced version of basic experiments with monochords and sonometers.},

title = {Monte Carlo Simulations of Globular Cluster Evolution. VI. The Influence  of an Intermediate Mass Black Hole},
abstract = { We present results of a series of Monte Carlo simulations investigating the imprint of a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) on the structure of a globular cluster. We investigate the three-dimensional and projected density profiles, and stellar disruption rates for idealized as well as realistic cluster models, taking into account a stellar mass spectrum and stellar evolution, and allowing for a larger, more realistic, number of stars than was previously possible with direct N-body methods. We compare our results to other N-body and Fokker-Planck simulations published previously. We find, in general, very good agreement for the overall cluster structure and dynamical evolution between direct {\$}N{\$}-body simulations and our Monte Carlo simulations. Significant differences exist in the number of stars that are tidally disrupted by the IMBH, which is most likely an effect of the wandering motion of the IMBH, not included in the Monte Carlo scheme. These differences, however, are negligible for the final IMBH masses in realistic cluster models as the disruption rates are generally much lower than for single-mass clusters. As a test to observations we model the cluster NGC 5694, which is known to possess a central surface brightness cusp consistent with the presence of an IMBH. We find that not only the inner slope but also the outer part of the surface brightness profile agrees with corresponding observations. This provides further evidence for the possible existence of a central IMBH in NGC5694. },

title = {Benchmark problems for continuum radiative transfer. High optical depths, anisotropic scattering, and polarisation},
abstract = {Aims: Solving the continuum radiative transfer equation in high opacity media requires sophisticated numerical tools. In order to test the reliability of such tools, we present a benchmark of radiative transfer codes in a 2D disc configuration. Methods: We test the accuracy of seven independently developed radiative transfer codes by comparing the temperature structures, spectral energy distributions, scattered light images, and linear polarisation maps that each model predicts for a variety of disc opacities and viewing angles. The test cases have been chosen to be numerically challenging, with midplane optical depths up 10^6, a sharp density transition at the inner edge and complex scattering matrices. We also review recent progress in the implementation of the Monte Carlo method that allow an efficient solution to these kinds of problems and discuss the advantages and limitations of Monte Carlo codes compared to those of discrete ordinate codes. Results: For each of the test cases, the predicted results from the radiative transfer codes are within good agreement. The results indicate that these codes can be confidently used to interpret present and future observations of protoplanetary discs.},

abstract = { Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have revolutionised Bayesian data analysis over the years by making the direct computation of posterior probability densities feasible on modern workstations. However, the calculation of the prior predictive, the Bayesian evidence, has proved to be notoriously difficult with standard techniques. In this work a method is presented that lets one calculate the Bayesian evidence using nothing but the results from standard MCMC algorithms, like Metropolis-Hastings. This new method is compared to other methods like MultiNest, and greatly outperforms the latter in several cases. One of the toy problems considered in this work is the analysis of mock pulsar timing data, as encountered in pulsar timing array projects. This method is expected to be useful as well in other problems in astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics. },

title = {Atmospheric Circulation of Exoplanets},
abstract = { We survey the basic principles of atmospheric dynamics relevant to explaining existing and future observations of exoplanets, both gas giant and terrestrial. Given the paucity of data on exoplanet atmospheres, our approach is to emphasize fundamental principles and insights gained from Solar-System studies that are likely to be generalizable to exoplanets. We begin by presenting the hierarchy of basic equations used in atmospheric dynamics, including the Navier-Stokes, primitive, shallow-water, and two-dimensional nondivergent models. We then survey key concepts in atmospheric dynamics, including the importance of planetary rotation, the concept of balance, and scaling arguments to show how turbulent interactions generally produce large-scale east-west banding on rotating planets. We next turn to issues specific to giant planets, including their expected interior and atmospheric thermal structures, the implications for their wind patterns, and mechanisms to pump their east-west jets. Hot Jupiter atmospheric dynamics are given particular attention, as these close-in planets have been the subject of most of the concrete developments in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. We then turn to the basic elements of circulation on terrestrial planets as inferred from Solar-System studies, including Hadley cells, jet streams, processes that govern the large-scale horizontal temperature contrasts, and climate, and we discuss how these insights may apply to terrestrial exoplanets. Although exoplanets surely possess a greater diversity of circulation regimes than seen on the planets in our Solar System, our guiding philosophy is that the multi-decade study of Solar-System planets reviewed here provides a foundation upon which our understanding of more exotic exoplanetary meteorology must build. },

title = {Metallicity, planet formation, and disc lifetimes},
abstract = { The formation of planets within a disc must operate within the time frame of disc dispersal, it is thus crucial to establish what is the dominant process that disperses the gaseous component of discs around young stars. Planet formation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the central young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal mechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity dependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate between these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the dispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by means of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium irradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show t_phot \propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical estimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on metallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet formation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should therefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by Yasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~- 0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational evidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with the predictions of a pure photoevaporation model. [abridged] We finally develop an analytical framework to study the effects of metallicity dependent photoevaporation on the formation of gas giants in the core accretion scenario. We show that accounting for this effect strengthens the conclusion that planet formation is favoured at higher metallicity. [abridged] },

title = {Wide-Field Near-Infrared Imaging of the L1551 Dark Cloud},
abstract = {We present wide-field near-infrared images of the densest part of the L1551 dark cloud taken with the narrow-band filters for [Fe II] λ 1.644 μm and H2 v = 1-0 S(1) lines, together with the broadband H and K s filters. Numerous [Fe II] and H2 emission features were detected from the regions around HL/XZ Tau, HH 30, HH 262, L1551 NE, and L1551 IRS 5. Most of the [Fe II] features are compact or jet-like, suggesting that the emission arises from fast shocks occurring in the ejecta of jets. The H2 features are more diffuse and widely distributed in outflow lobes, with none of the H2 features showing the well-collimated emission associated with jets. This implies that the H2 emission originates from slower shocks where the ejecta interacts with ambient material. The outflow structure in the vicinity of the deeply embedded object L1551 NE is revealed, featuring a well-collimated, spatially continuous [Fe II] jet penetrating a fan-shaped infrared reflection nebula. The tangential velocities of knots in the L1551 NE jet are estimated to be 140-190 km s-1 from their proper motions, implying an inclination of 45$\,^{\circ}$-60$\,^{\circ}$ for the jet axis. A counter-jet from L1551 IRS 5 is detected for the first time in [Fe II]; this probably corresponds to the northern-most of the two jets on the blueshifted side. The relative brightness of the counter-jet suggests a visual extinction of 20-30 mag. The [Fe II] emissions from collimated jets are relatively strong toward L1551 NE and L1551 IRS 5 compared to those toward HL Tau and HH 30. This implies that the jets from the former objects, which are more embedded, have a higher shock velocity and/or a larger gas density than the latter, more revealed objects. The results presented here show that the near-infrared [Fe II] emission is a useful probe of well-collimated jets from deeply embedded sources, in much the same way that optical [S II] emission is used for relatively revealed objects.

title = {Dust Transport in Protostellar Disks Through Turbulence and Settling},
abstract = { We apply ionization balance and MHD calculations to investigate whether magnetic activity moderated by recombination on dust can account for the mass accretion rates and the mid-infrared spectra and variability of protostellar disks. The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and include grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the resistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri stars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar X-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk magnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling of grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence, through three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically inactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the magnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only about one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically in waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the laminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk atmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone is thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also show that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the atmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few orbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface varies by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit. We suggest that the changing shadows cast by the dust clouds on the outer disk are a cause of the daily to monthly mid-infrared variability in some young stars. (Abridged.) },

abstract = { Numerical integration of the differential equations of light propagation in the Schwarzschild metric shows that in some extreme situations relevant for practical observations (e.g. for Gaia) the well-known standard post-Newtonian formula for the boundary problem has an error up to 16 \muas. The aim of this note is to identify the reason for this error and to derive an extended formula accurate at the level of 1 \muas as needed e.g. for Gaia.  The analytical parametrized post-post-Newtonian solution for light propagation derived by \citet{report1} gives the solution for the boundary problem with all analytical terms of order {\$}{\O}O4{\$} taken into account. Giving an analytical upper estimates of each term we investigate which post-post-Newtonian terms may play a role for an observer in the solar system at the level of 1 \muas. We conclude that only one post-post-Newtonian term remains important for this numerical accuracy and derive a simplified analytical solution for the boundary problem for light propagation containing all the terms that are indeed relevant at the level of 1 \muas. The derived analytical solution has been verified using the results of a high-accuracy numerical integration of differential equations of light propagation and found to be correct at the level well below 1 \muas for arbitrary observer situated within the solar system. },

title = {Resolving the circumbinary dust disk surrounding HH 30},
abstract = {Context: The jet-disk connection is an important part of the star formation process. HH 30 is a rare and beautiful example of a system exhibiting a flared edge-on disk, an optical jet and a CO molecular outflow. A recent analysis of the jet wiggling has revealed that the central star is in reality a binary object. Therefore, the dust and gas disk observed around HH 30 is circumbinary. Aims: In this paper, we attempt to better constrain the system (disk + stars) properties, as well as the system age. Methods: We obtained very high angular resolution (˜ 0.4'') observations in continuum at 1.3 mm with the IRAM interferometer. A standard disk model is used to fit the continuum and line data in the Fourier-plane and derive the disk properties. Results: We find that the disk of HH 30 is truncated at an inner radius 37 $\pm$ 4 AU. The simplest explanation is tidal truncation in a binary system. This confirms the binarity of the HH 30 system, which consists of two stars on a low eccentricity, 15 AU semi-major axis orbit. The jet wiggling is due to orbital motion. The mass ratio is poorly constrained. The system age may be less than 2 Myr. The disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm and the dust opacity index, β ≈ 0.4, indicates the presence of cm size grains. Conclusions: These observations confirm that HH 30, often presented as an archetypal example of the jet-disk paradigm, is a binary star, with one of the components at the origin of the optical jet. This suggests that many other objects similar to HH 30 may be unknown binary or multiple systems. These new data confirm that high angular resolution observations at millimeter wavelengths are powerful tools to unveil the inner dust disk properties. In this domain, ALMA will likely change our observational vision of these objects. PdBI is operated by IRAM, which is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).},

abstract = {
A flexible and fast Monte Carlo-based model of diffuse reflectance has been developed for the extraction of the absorption and scattering properties of turbid media, such as human tissues. This method is valid for a wide range of optical properties and is easily adaptable to existing probe geometries, provided a single phantom calibration measurement is made.
A condensed Monte Carlo method was used to speed up the forward simulations. This model was validated by use of two sets of liquid-tissue phantoms containing Nigrosin or hemoglobin as absorbers and polystyrene spheres as scatterers. The phantoms had a wide range of absorption
(0-20 cm−1) and reduced scattering coefficients
(7-33 cm−1). Mie theory and a spectrophotometer were used to determine the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of the phantoms. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the phantoms were measured over a wavelength range of
350-850 nm. It was found that optical properties could be extracted from the experimentally measured diffuse reflectance spectra with an average error of
3% or less for phantoms containing hemoglobin and
12% or less for phantoms containing Nigrosin.},

This maximal entropy random walk is equivalent to generic random walk if it takes place on a regular lattice, but it is not if the underlying lattice is irregular. In particular, we consider a lattice with weak dilution. We show that the stationary probability of finding a particle performing maximal entropy random walk localizes in the largest nearly spherical region of the lattice which is free of defects. This localization phenomenon, which is purely classical in nature, is explained in terms of the Lifshitz states of a certain random operator. },

In this particular case, Mie theory describes the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with spherical dust grains on the basis of their complex refractive index and size parameter. Both, broad grain size distributions (radii a: nanometers-millimeters) and a very wide wavelength range (λ~10-10-10-2m) of the interacting radiation are considered. Previous numerical solutions to the Mie scattering problem are not appropriate to consider size parameters x=2πa/λ>104-105. In contrast to this, the presented code allows to consider arbitrary size parameters. It will be useful not only for applications in astrophysics but also in other fields of science (atmospheric and ocean optics, biophysics, etc.) and industry (particle sizing, ecology control measurements, etc.). Method of solution: Calculations of Mie scattering coefficients and efficiency factors as outlined by Voshchinnikov (2004), combined with standard solutions of the scattering amplitude functions. Single scattering by particle ensembles is calculated by proper averaging of the respective parameters. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: Single scattering Typical running time: Seconds to minutes Unusual features of the program: None References: C.F. Bohren, D.R.

Propagation of light into scattering media is a complex problem that can be modeled using statistical methods such as Monte Carlo. Few Monte Carlo programs have so far included the information regarding the status of polarization of light before and after a scattering event. Different approaches have been followed and limited numerical values have been made available to the general public. In this paper, three different ways to build a Monte Carlo program for light propagation with polarization are given. Different groups have used the first two methods; the third method is original. Comparison in between Monte Carlo runs and Adding Doubling program yielded less than 1 % error.},

title = {Dust Processing and Mineralogy in Protoplanetary Accretion Disks},
abstract = { We discuss the different dust components of a protoplanetary disk with a special emphasis on grain composition, size and structure. The paper will highlight the role dust grains play in protoplanetary disks, as well as observational results supporting this knowledge. First, the path dust travels from the interstellar medium into the CS disk is described. Then dust condensation sequences from the gas are introduced, to determine the most likely species that occur in a disk. The characteristics of silicates are handled in detail: composition, lattice structure, magnesium to iron ratio and spectral features. The other main dust-forming component of the interstellar medium, carbon, is presented in its many forms, from molecules to more complex grains. Observational evidence for PAHs is given for both young stars and solar system material. We show how light scattering theory and laboratory data can be used to provide the optical properties of dust grains. From the observer's point of view, we discuss how infrared spectra can be used to derive dust properties, and present the main spectral analysis methods currently used and their limitations. Observational results, determining the dust properties in protoplanetary disks, are given: first for the bright intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars, and then for the lower-mass Tauri stars and brown dwarfs. Here we present results from the space observatories ISO and Spitzer, as well as from the mid-infrared interferometer VLTI, and summarise the main findings. We discuss observational evidence for grain growth in both Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri stars, and its relation with spectral type and dust settling. We conclude with an outlook on future space missions that will open new windows, towards longer wavelengths and even fainter objects. },

Due to the finite aperture of an observer's eye or a telescope, Fraunhofer diffraction has to be taken into account. We have used high performance graphics hardware and developed a program that enables the user to interactively explore the stellar sky in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole. To do so, we determine what an observer, who can either move quasistatically around the black hole or follow a timelike radial geodesic, would actually see.},

An algorithm is presented based on an evolution strategy to retrieve a particle size distribution from angular light-scattering data. The analyzed intensity patterns are generated using the Mie theory, and the algorithm retrieves a series of known normal, gamma, and lognormal distributions by using the Fraunhofer approximation. The distributions scan the interval of modal size parameters 100 ≤ α- ≤ 150. The numerical results show that the evolution strategy can be successfully applied to solve this kind of inverse problem, obtaining a more accurate solution than, for example, the Chin-Shifrin inversion method, and avoiding the use of a priori information concerning the domain of the distribution, commonly necessary for reconstructing the particle size distribution when this analytical
inversion method is used.},

870 nm with those predicted by three theories, namely, Rayleigh-Debye-Gans
(RDG) approximation, volume-equivalent Mie theory, and integral equation formulation for scattering (IEFS). Soot particles, produced by a premixed ethene flame, were size-selected using two differential mobility analyzers in series, and their scattering and absorption coefficients were measured with nephelometry and photoacoustic spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy and image processing techniques were used for the parameterization of the structural properties of the fractal-like soot aggregates. The aggregate structural parameters were used to evaluate the predictions of the optical coefficients based on the three light-scattering and absorption theories. Our results show that the RDG approximation agrees within 10% with the experimental results and the exact electromagnetic calculations of the IEFS theory. Volume-equivalent Mie theory overpredicts the experimental scattering coefficient by a factor of
∼3.2.
The optical coefficients predicted by the RDG approximation showed pronounced sensitivity to changes in monomer mean diameter, the count median diameter of the aggregates, and the geometric standard deviation of the aggregate number size distribution.},

title = {Hubble Space Telescope Optical Imaging of the Eroding Debris Disk HD  61005},
abstract = { We present Hubble Space Telescope optical coronagraphic polarization imaging observations of the dusty debris disk HD 61005. The scattered light intensity image and polarization structure reveal a highly inclined disk with a clear asymmetric, swept back component, suggestive of significant interaction with the ambient interstellar medium. The combination of our new data with the published 1.1 micron discovery image shows that the grains are blue scattering with no strong color gradient as a function of radius, implying predominantly sub-micron sized grains. We investigate possible explanations that could account for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has suggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense interstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column density from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this possibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm, low-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits. This mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a typical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow direction-parallel to the disk midplane-we find that the structures generated by these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology. Future observational studies constraining the direction of the relative interstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future modeling. Independent of the interpretation for HD 61005, we expect that interstellar gas drag likely plays a role in producing asymmetries observed in other debris disk systems, such as HD 15115 and Delta-Velorum. },

The 3DRT framework discussed in the previous papers of this series was added to our general-purpose model atmosphere code PHOENIX/1D and an extended 3D version PHOENIX/3D was created. The \phxT code is parallelized via the MPI library using a hierarchical domain decomposition and displays very good strong scaling. We present the results of several test cases for widely different atmosphere conditions and compare the 3D calculations with equivalent 1D models to assess the internal accuracy of the 3D modeling. In addition, we show the results for a number of parameterized 3D structures. With presently available computational resources it is possible to solve the full 3D radiative transfer (including scattering) problem with the same micro-physics as included in 1D modeling. },

abstract = { Stacking analysis is a means of detecting faint sources using a priori position information to estimate an aggregate signal from individually undetected objects. Confusion severely limits the effectiveness of stacking in deep surveys with limited angular resolution, particularly at far infrared to submillimeter wavelengths, and causes a bias in stacking results. Deblending corrects measured fluxes for confusion from adjacent sources; however, we find that standard deblending methods only reduce the bias by roughly a factor of two while tripling the variance. We present an improved algorithm for simultaneous stacking and deblending that greatly reduces bias in the flux estimate with nearly minimum variance. When confusion from neighboring sources is the dominant error, our method improves upon RMS error by at least a factor of three and as much as an order of magnitude compared to other algorithms. This improvement will be useful for Herschel and other telescopes working in a source confused, low signal to noise regime. },

abstract = {Context: Circumstellar discs are expected to be the nursery of planets. Grain growth within such discs is the first step in the planet formation process. The Bok globule CB 26 harbours such a young disc. Aims: We present a detailed model of the edge-on circumstellar disc and its envelope in the Bok globule CB 26. Methods: The model is based on HST near-infrared maps in the I, J, H, and K bands, OVRO and SMA radio maps at 1.1 mm, 1.3 mm and 2.7 mm, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) from 0.9 {μ m} to 3 mm. New photometric and spectroscopic data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Caltech Submilimeter Observatory are also part of our analysis. Using the self-consistent radiative transfer code MC3D, the model we construct is able to discriminate between parameter sets and dust properties of both envelope and disc. Results: We find that the data are fit by a disc that has an inner hole with a radius of 45$\pm$5 AU. Based on a dust model including silicate and graphite, the maximum grain size needed to reproduce the spectral millimetre index is 2.5 {μ m}. Features seen in the near-infrared images, dominated by scattered light, can be described as a result of a rotating envelope. Conclusions: Successful employment of ISM dust in both the disc and envelope hint that grain growth may not yet play a significant role for the appearance of this system. A large inner hole implies that CB 26 is a circumbinary disc.},

Our observations reveal the presence of a dominant periodic modulation of the polarization with a period of 7.49 $\pm$ 0.04 days or one of the aliases of this period close to 1 day. There are also suggestions of a weak periodic modulation in the photometry with the same period but a phase displaced by one quarter of a period. These results are in agreement with the lighthouse model for HH 30, in which a beam or shadow from a central source sweeps across the disk. Our observations by themselves appear to be consistent with both of the mechanisms that have been proposed for the lighthouse---asymmetric accretion hot spots on the star or orbiting clumps or voids in the disk---and provide strong quantitative constraints for future models.},

title = {The Indirect Search for Dark Matter with IceCube},
abstract = { We revisit the prospects for IceCube and similar kilometer-scale telescopes to detect neutrinos produced by the annihilation of weakly interacting massive dark matter particles (WIMPs) in the Sun. We emphasize that the astrophysics of the problem is understood; models can be observed or, alternatively, ruled out. In searching for a WIMP with spin-independent interactions with ordinary matter, IceCube is only competitive with direct detection experiments if the WIMP mass is sufficiently large. For spin-dependent interactions IceCube already has improved the best limits on spin-dependent WIMP cross sections by two orders of magnitude. This is largely due to the fact that models with significant spin-dependent couplings to protons are the least constrained and, at the same time, the most promising because of the efficient capture of WIMPs in the Sun. We identify models where dark matter particles are beyond the reach of any planned direct detection experiments while being within reach of neutrino telescopes. In summary, we find that, even when contemplating recent direct detection results, neutrino telescopes have the opportunity to play an important as well as complementary role in the search for particle dark matter. },

title = {HST/STIS observations of the RW Aurigae bipolar jet: mapping the physical parameters close to the source},
abstract = {Context: We present the results of new spectral diagnostic investigations applied to high-resolution long-slit spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) of the jet from the T Tauri star RW Aur. Aims: Our primary goal is to determine basic physical parameters (electron density ne and electron temperature Te, hydrogen ionisation fraction xe, total hydrogen density nH, radial velocity vr and the mass outflow rate dot Mj) along both the red- and blueshifted lobes of the RW Aur jet. Methods: The input dataset consists of seven long-slit spectra, of 0.1 arcsec spatial resolution, taken with the STIS slit parallel to the jet, and stepped across it. We use the Bacciotti {\&} Eisl{\"o}ffel (1999, A{\&}A, 342, 717) method to analyse the forbidden doublets [O I]λλ6300,6363, [S II]λλ 6716,6731, and [N II]λλ 6548,6583 {\AA} to extract n_e, T_e, x_e, and n_H. Results: We were able to extract the parameters as far as 3.9 arcsec in the red- and 2.1 arcsec in the blueshifted beam. The electron density at the base of both lobes is close to the critical density for [S II] emission but then it decreases gradually with distance from the source. The range of electron temperatures derived for this jet (Te = 10^4-2×104 K) is similar to those generally found in other outflows from young stars. The ionisation fraction xe varies between 0.04 and 0.4, increasing within the first few arcseconds and then decreasing in both lobes. The total hydrogen density, derived as nH = ne / x_e, is on average 3.2×104 cm-3 and shows a gradual decrease along the beam. Variations of the above quantities along the jet lobes appear to be correlated with the position of knots. Combining the derived parameters with vr measured from the HST spectra and other characteristics available for this jet, we estimate dot Mj following two different procedures. The mass-outflow rate dot Mj is moderate and similar in the two lobes, despite the fact that the well-known asymmetry in the radial velocity persists close to the source. Using the results of the BE diagnostics we find averages along the first 2.1 arcsec of both flows (a region presumably not yet affected by interaction with the jet environment) of 2.6×10-9 M_{\.o} yr-1 for the red lobe and 2.0×10-9 M_{\.o} yr-1 for the blueshifted flow, with an uncertainty of $\pm$ log M_{\.o} = 1.6. Conclusions: The fact that the derived mass outflow rate is similar in the two lobes appears to indicate that the central engine is constrained on the two sides of the system and that the observed asymmetries are due to environmental conditions. Possible suggestions for the origin of the differences are discussed. The RW Aur jet appears to be the second densest outflow from a T Tauri star studied so far, but its other properties are quite similar to those found in other jets from young stars, suggesting that a common acceleration mechanism operates in these sources.

title = {Chemical depletion in the Large Magellanic Cloud: RV Tauri stars and the  photospheric feedback from their dusty discs},
abstract = { Aims: By studying the photospheric abundances of 4 RV Tauri stars in the LMC, we test whether the depletion pattern of refractory elements, seen in similar Galactic sources, is also common for extragalactic sources. Since this depletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc, we investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. Methods: A detailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution UVES optical spectra. To study the circumstellar environment we use photometric data to construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine the geometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution Spitzer-IRS infrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. Results: Our results show that, also in the LMC, the photospheres of RV Tauri stars are commonly affected by the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength from source to source. From our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, we find that this process, as in the Galaxy, appears closely related to the presence of a stable Keplerian disc. The newly studied extragalactic objects have similar observational characteristics as Galactic post-AGB binaries surrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of a binary system. One source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for a disc source, but still has evidence for depletion. We speculate this could point to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seen around young stellar objects. },

title = {Adaptive Mesh Fluid Simulations on GPU},
abstract = { We describe an implementation of compressible inviscid fluid solvers with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement on Graphics Processing Units using NVIDIA's CUDA. We show that a class of high resolution shock capturing schemes can be mapped naturally on this architecture. Using the method of lines approach with the second order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time integration scheme, piecewise linear reconstruction, and a Harten-Lax-van Leer Riemann solver, we achieve an overall speedup of approximately 10 times faster execution on one graphics card as compared to a single core on the host computer. We attain this speedup in uniform grid runs as well as in problems with deep AMR hierarchies. Our framework can readily be applied to more general systems of conservation laws and extended to higher order shock capturing schemes. This is shown directly by an implementation of a magneto-hydrodynamic solver and comparing its performance to the pure hydrodynamic case. Finally, we also combined our CUDA parallel scheme with MPI to make the code run on GPU clusters. Close to ideal speedup is observed on up to four GPUs. },
